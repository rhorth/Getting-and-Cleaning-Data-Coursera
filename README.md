##Information on the R code <run_analysis.R>:

####Required libraries:
- plyr
- memisc

####Required data files:
This data can be obtained from (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

####Procedures performed in code:
- Step 1. Set working directory and load libraries
- Step 2. Read in files
- Step 3. Clean up train and test files and create one dataset for each
- Step 4. Merge the cleaned test and train datasets
- Step 5. Create a new tidy dataset with mean of numeric columns and relabeled variables 

####Code output
The code outputs a text file that contains for each record:
- Activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- The means of the mean and standard deviation of the different measurements (described in detail in the codebook).

####Summary information on how data was obtained:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the team captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
