#DATA DICTIONARY 
####Dataset: UCI_HAR_means.txt

The dataset contains 180 lines of data. Each line of data corresponds to 6 types of activities (**column 2**) recorded per 30 participants (**column 1**).

The dataset contains a summary of the means across the mean values and means across the standard deviations for each participant and type of activity for the measurements (**columns 3-81**) described below. 

##   subjectid
Description: Participant unique identification number (**column 1**)

Storage mode: integer

Factor with 6 levels:

	- Numbers 1 to 30    
	
##   activity
Description: Type of activity performed (**column 2**)

Storage mode: integer

Factor with 6 levels:

	- 'LAYING'                      
 	- 'SITTING'                   
	- 'STANDING'                    
	- 'WALKING'                     
	- 'WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS'          
	- 'WALKING_UPSTAIRS'            

##  variables in columns 3 to 81
Description: Type of measurement captured (**columns 3-81**)

Storage mode: numeric

Numeric values with variable names containing the descriptions summarized below:

	- The values present the mean values for each participant and activity for each measurement (denoted by **Mean** at initial of variable name)
 	- The values for these variables come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals (denoted by **X**, **Y** or **Z**).
 	- The time domain signals time (denoted by **Time**) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. These signals were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
 	- The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (denoted by **BodyAcc** and **GravityAcc**) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
 	- The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (denoted by **BodyAccJerk** and **BodyGyroJerk**). 
 	- The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (denoted by **BodyAccMag**, **GravityAccMag**, **BodyAccJerkMag**, **BodyGyroMag**, **BodyGyroJerkMag**). 
 	- A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequency domain signals (denoted by **Freq**). 
 	- The mean and the standard deviations of the above listed measurements are denoted by **Mean** and **Std**.
